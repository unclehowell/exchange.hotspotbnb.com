# Private Virtual Curerncy (BTC) Securities Exchange

## This prototype/ mockup for an open-source Private Virtual Currency Securities Exchange. 

### The general idea was you have 100 tokens (the platform used BTC at the time). Each would reflect a share in your website/ startup.  

### We didn't realise it at the time but this was the origins of the idea for our DAO
