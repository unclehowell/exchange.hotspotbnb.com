# Private Virtual Curerncy (BTC) Securities Exchange

## This prototype/ mockup for an open-source Private Virtual Currency Securities Exchange. 

### The general idea was you have, say 100 tokens (this used BTC at the time). Each would reflect a share in your website/ startup.  And we'd open-source/ whitelabel it, so anyone could host it on their webserver and integrate it with their website too. Then forget the FTSE, SME etc (This was before the advent and popularity of ICO's, and only a few months after the world fist recorded ICO).

### So I issued our 50+ seed fund investors (at the time) some BTC so they could try it. A PDF certificate of sovereign/ trust/ allodial ownership would generate too (sadly banks rejected it, their outranking belief at the time was just hundreds of thousands of GBP's vanished into thin air). Each certificate would append the welsh patronymic before the co-owners family names, to keep it all legal and lawful (because contracting with a Crown Copyright entity would have placed this under the 1801 UK Society juristiction, as oppose to our capacity as free British Subjects and countrymen and women. The welsh patronym is by some freak coincidence 'Ap' (similar to App). Hence why some of my publications elsewhere online e.g. Issuu - use Hywel ApBuckler as oppose to Sion Hywel Buckler.

### We didn't realise it at the time but this was the origins of the idea for our DAO
