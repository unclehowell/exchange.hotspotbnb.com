# Private Virtual Curerncy (BTC) Securities Exchange

## This prototype/ mockup for an open-source Private Virtual Currency Securities Exchange. 

### The general idea was you have, say 100 tokens (this used BTC at the time). Each would reflect a share in your website/ startup.  

### So I issued our 50+ seed fund investors (at the time) some BTC so they could try it. A PDF certificate of sovereign/ trust/ allodial ownership would generate too (sadly banks rejected it). 

### We didn't realise it at the time but this was the origins of the idea for our DAO
